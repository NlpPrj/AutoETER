## Introduction
To explore the type information for any KG, we develop a novel KGE framework with ***Auto***mated ***E***ntity ***T***yp***E*** ***R***epresentation (AutoETER), which learns the latent type embedding of each entity by regarding each relation as a translation operation between the types of two entities with a relation-aware attention mechanism. Particularly, our approach could model and infer all the relation patterns and complex relations.
